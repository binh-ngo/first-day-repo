    <p>Hey guys! My name is Binh and I am a recent Seattle transplant. I was a chef for 5 years in Hawaii but desired a better work-life balance so I decided to pursue a career change into the world of coding. My current hobbies include cooking of course, basketball, volleyball, and lifting. Since I moved here without knowing many people, I hope to make new friends who are willing to collaborate and push me to becoming a better coder and a better person.</p>
